<th scope="row">Low Gluten-Free Population</th>
<td>"estimates about 6% to 7% of the U.S. population may be gluten-sensitive, meaning some 20 million people in the United States alone could have the condition." - Dr. Fasano, director of the University of Maryland Center for Celiac</td>
<td>Low population of gluten-free abiding people is a root cause for expensively priced gluten-free foods or understocked gluten-free foods. This, however, does not encompass all gluten-free individuals. while the 6-7% of people who have celiac disease are those who are medicaly required to avoid gluten the rest of the gluten-free population is left out of these .</td>
<td>There is no solution to the low population of gluten-free people as we can't force more people to become gluten-free. There are, however, many solutions to the resulting affects such as high price and low availibility. One possible solution is to spread awareness for those who struggle finding food.</td>

      <td>"He also participated in the research concluding that celiac disease incidence is one in every 133 people." - Dr. Fasano, director of the University of Maryland Center for Celiac</td>
      <td>This is a problem because not all who follow a gluten-free lifesyle have celiac disease or gluten intolerance. A majority of those who follow a glute-free lifestyle or choose to avoid gluten in some asepct do so volountarily for a variety of reasons. </td>
      <td>Again there is no solution to low levels of gluten-free people but there are solutions to unavailibity in gluten-free products. One solution is to make a website where recipes and products can be shared between gluten free individuals to help those who are searching for gluten-free alternatives or gluten-free foods in general(hint hint nudge nudge).</td>

<th scope="row">Too expensive</th>
<td>"mGFFs(manufactured gluten-free foods) are recognized to be GFF and they are consideredto be economic burden" - Mahir Turhan, British university of Nicosia</td>
<td>Stores view stocking gluten-free items as an "economic burder" leading to overpricing them, or not stocking them entirely. This creates an environemt where those living a gluten-free lifestyle have to pay more than ordinary people. To call the only food people living gluten-free lifestyles volountarily and those with celiac disease an economic burden is unacceptable in our day and age.</td>
<td>There are obvious solutions to this problem. One solution is lowering prices of gluten free foods to relatively match the price of their gluten counterparts. Another solution is to make more gluten free food so the price would go down entirely worldwide. With more gluten-free foods availible to stores, the prices of each food would go down alowing stores to in turn price them lower to help prevent overpriciing.</td>

    <tr>
      <th scope="row"></th>
      <td>"The extra cost for consuming mGFFs comprises a considerable part of the lowest income (5.4 - 13.3%) which is a heavy economic burden for the population making the livingwith the lowest income. Consuming mGFFs for low-incomersis almost beyond imagination." - Mahir Turhan, British university of Nicosia</td>
      <td>This is directly addressing the problem high prices of gluten-free foods causes. Those with low incomes struggle with living a gluten free lifestyle. Additionaly, those with low incomes who also have celiac disease face serious medical problems if they re unable to attain suuitable foods with their income. </td>
      <td>Another sultion to this problem is to budget more to accomodate for gluten free foods. With a larger budget provided by the government, stores wouldnt see stocking gluten-free foods as a loss. They would be more willing to stock a larger variety of gluten-free foods and they would acommadate a larger population of gluten-free people leading to increased sales. </td>
