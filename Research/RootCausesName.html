<td>"estimates about 6% to 7% of the U.S. population may be gluten-sensitive, meaning some 20 million people in the United States alone could have the condition." - Dr. Fasano, director of the University of Maryland Center for Celiac</td>
<td>Low population of gluten-free abiding people is a root cause for expensively priced gluten-free foods or understocked gluten-free foods. This, however, does not encompass all gluten-free individuals. while the 6-7% of people who have celiac disease are those who are medicaly required to avoid gluten the rest of the gluten-free population is left out of these .</td>
<td>There is no solution to the low population of gluten-free people as we can't force more people to become gluten-free. There are, however, many solutions to the resulting affects such as high price and low availibility. One possible solution is to spread awareness for those who struggle finding food.</td>

      <th scope="row"></th>
      <td>"He also participated in the research concluding that celiac disease incidence is one in every 133 people." - Dr. Fasano, director of the University of Maryland Center for Celiac</td>
      <td>This is a problem because not all who follow a gluten-free lifesyle have celiac disease or gluten intolerance. A majority of those who follow a glute-free lifestyle or choose to avoid gluten in some asepct do so volountarily for a variety of reasons. </td>
      <td>Again there is no solution to low levels of gluten-free people but there are solutions to unavailibity in gluten-free products. One solution is to make a website where recipes and products can be shared between gluten free individuals to help those who are searching for gluten-free alternatives or gluten-free food in general(hint hint nudge nudge).</td>

<td>Stores view stocking gluten-free items as an "economic burder" leading to overpricing them, or not stocking them entirely.</td>
